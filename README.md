ðŸŒ± Branching Workflow

To maintain clean and collaborative development:

main â†’ Always contains production-ready code.

dev â†’ Integration branch where new features are merged after review.

feature/your-feature-name â†’ Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.

Example workflow
# Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/login-page

# Work on your changes, commit regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Added login page UI"

# Push branch to remote
git push origin feature/login-page

Once the feature is complete, open a Pull Request (PR) into dev. After testing and approval, code will be merged into main.

âœ… Youâ€™re all set to start developing!
